# LuciooBot
This is just a simple project off a Twitch chat bot that I'm using to learn and test my Python skills.

Right now it doesn't do much, only conecct to a server and respond do !fyeah, but I have some ideas to do in the future.


Basic things that I need to add:

[ ]Stream currency.

[ ]Auto moderation.

[ ]Custom chat respond to comands.

And some other things I remember after.
